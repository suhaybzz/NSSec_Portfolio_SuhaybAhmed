Hashes

MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 provide unique fingerprints of a file. In malware analysis these are used for IOC sharing and identifying known malware samples.

Strings

Extracting printable strings can reveal functionality clues such as file paths, registry keys, commands, or network indicators.

PE Header & Imports

Reading the Portable Executable structure shows entry point, image base, and imported Windows API functions. Malware often imports suspicious APIs such as CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAllocEx, WinExec.

IOC Extraction

Scanning for URLs and IP addresses helps analysts find C2 servers or suspicious network activity.

YARA

YARA rules detect patterns inside binaries. I created a rule that matches the string “http” to demonstrate signature-based classification.

Full Triage Workflow

Combining all steps replicates a realistic malware triage workflow used in SOCs and threat intelligence.
